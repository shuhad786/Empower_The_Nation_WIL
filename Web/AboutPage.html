                <h2>Welcome to Empowering the Nation</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2022 by Precious Radebe, Empowering the Nation is a proudly South African initiative dedicated to uplifting domestic workers and gardeners through practical, culturally relevant training.<br /><br />
                    Our programmes blend traditional wisdom with modern skills, creating opportunities for sustainable employment and personal growth. Whether you're looking for a six-month Learnership or a Short Skills Training Programme, we are here to guide you every step of the way.<br /><br />
                    We believe in the power of community and the dignity of work. By equipping individuals with valuable life and work skills, we help unlock doors to brighter futures for families and communities.<br /><br />
                    Together with our partners and supporters, we strive to foster resilience, confidence, and lasting change in the lives of those we serve. Our vision is a nation where every worker is empowered, respected, and given opportunities to thrive.
